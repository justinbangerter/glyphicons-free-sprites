glyphicons-free-sprites
=======================

A spritemap and css classes for the free version of GLYPHICONS

Generated with [this project](https://github.com/justinbangerter/glyphicons-sprite-generator)

By default, all glyphs are commented out from glyph/glyphicons.scss.
To clear all comments, you can run the following in vim.
    %s_//__

You may also open index.html in a browser to preview the icons to help you pick the ones you like.

To enable an icon, uncomment it from glyph/glyphicons.scss and run watch.sh.

Once compiled, you can drop the glyph folder into your project and use glyph.css
